## How to use To-do list

This is my third project on frontend dev course. This time in my new web you can create your own To-do list. 
First write down any task you have to do, click "Dodaj zadanie" and you will see your task on the list.
When you will do, click a green square - it will show you checkark and this task will be crossed out. 
After all you can click a red square - it removes task.
